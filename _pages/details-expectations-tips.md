## Course Expectations

Latin 101 is the first course in a two-semester introduction to the Latin language. The goal by the end of the year is to read Classical Latin, and in Latin 101 we will cover most of Latin morphology and a good deal of Latin syntax. Alongside our study of the Latin language, we will also have frequent discussions about Latin culture and history through examination of ancient coins, manuscripts, and inscriptions.
The course will use a flipped classroom and active learning pedagogy. What that means is that you will be responsible for previewing the material that we will cover in class ahead of time. You will read the relevant grammatical overviews and familiarize yourself with basic morphology and vocabulary before coming to class. I will keep you to this by giving you a short, simple quiz at the beginning of class. Class time will be spent employing your newly developed knowledge through a variety of activities that explore the finer points of the material and answering lingering questions about the material. My role is to facilitate your learning rather than to dictate how you do it.

Aside from daily quizzes, all assessments will take place outside of class and will focus on developing the active skills necessary to understand Latin. The intent here is to give you time and space to engage with the material at your own pace. Further, you will have an opportunity to revise all of your assignments since learning is best done iteratively (i.e. repetitively).

Finally, this course is CBL (community-based learning) designate class. As such, outreach and community engagement is a required part of the course. Beginning in October, you will be asked to commit at least one hour a week (usually between 3 – 4 PM; though some morning hours are valuable) to teach Latin to elementary school students in the Worcester area.

## Course Policies

### Absence Policy

If you miss or are going to miss class, please e-mail me to let me know what is going on. That way we can work together to ensure that you can stay up-to-date with what’s going on with the class. Should your absence fall under the college’s policy on excused absence, as described [here](https://hccatalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext), you will have an opportunity to make up any missed assessments.

### Academic Integrity

You are expected to abide by Holy Cross’ Academic Integrity Policy, posted [here](https://hccatalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext). Cheating on any assignment (for instance, using unauthorized notes to help answer questions, copying another student’s answers, or employing online translation programs) will result in penalties ranging from a failure on the specific assignment or quiz to failure for the entire course.

### Accommodations

Students who need accommodations should notify the instructor as soon as possible and work through the [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.holycross.edu/health-wellness-and-access/office-accessibility-services).

### Statement of Diversity and Inclusivity

It is my intent that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Because our course has a CBL component, it will also be incumbent on you to maintain these standards during school visits. You will be dealing with diverse set of populations, whose life experiences are, in many cases, different than your own. For support in these matters, you may find it useful to get in touch with [CBL office](https://www.holycross.edu/engaged-learning/donelan-office-community-based-learning/about-donelan-office).

## Tips for Doing Well in the Course

Below are list of best practices based on the behavior of students have done well in previous iterations of the course:

- Do not rely on class time to learn assigned material. Our discussions will build on the reading that I expect you to have completed for class.
- Read each the relevant material twice – once before class and once after. This will help to crystallize key concepts that we cover in class.
- Set aside time to study morphology and vocabulary (some tips: [here] (link here)) every day. This is essential for doing well in the course.
- Find a memorization strategy that works for you. It’s worth trying some of the online memorization tools (Quizlet, IFlash, etc.) to see if they can help!
- Visit me during office hours! I am here to help you learn as much as possible and I am happy to do whatever is necessary to assist you in achieving that goal.
- Take advantage of the resources available for you. I will set up a weekly session with SAC tutors for reviewing forms and for going over your translation and composition assignments. You can also work through [Academic Services and Learning Resources](https://www.holycross.edu/support-and-resources/academic-services-and-learning-resources) to get more individually tailored support.
