## Indirect Question

As we discussed last [semester](https://libatique.info/LATN101-F19/notes/6-indirect-statement/), there are two ways to report what someone says. We can report it directly by using quotations or we can report it indirectly by paraphrasing it.

While we use accusative and infinitive for paraphrasing declarative sentences, things get more complicated when we move beyond simple sentences. In this module, we will examine how Latin signals that it is paraphrasing a question, a grammatical construction known as indirect question.

Indirect questions consist of four key features:

- A verb of the head (i.e speaking, thinking, learning, perceiving, believing, seeing, agreeing, doubting) that sets up the indirect question
- An interrogative pronoun (quis/quid), adjective (qui, quae, quod), adverb (ubi, utrum)
- A subject that may be explicitly stated, implicit in the verb, or be a interrogative pronoun
- A verb in the subjunctive in accordance with [sequence of tenses](https://libatique.info/LATN101-F19/notes/7-temporal-clauses/) with one key exception (to be discussed below)

Take, for instance, the following sentence:

- Inquisivit quid dei dixissent.

Here **inquisivit** is verb of the head introducing the indirect question that follows. **Quid** is the interrogative word and **dei** is the subject. **Dixissent** is the verb in the subjunctive. (NB: Indirect questions frequently do not contain a question mark.)

When translating an indirect question, the only tricky thing is the subjunctive verb. Since the subjunctive mood is the marker of the fact that the question is indirect, we translate the subjunctive verb as an indicative verb, paying close attention to the sequence of tenses. In this case, we see that dixissent is in the pluperfect subjunctive illustrating that the verbs action happened prior to a past action. Thus we translate the above sentence as follows:

- He asked what the gods had said.

Below are some more examples of indirect questions:

- Hōc dubium est uter nostrum sit inverēcundior. (It is doubtful which one of us is more immodest.)
- Quam sīs audāx omnēs intellegere possunt. (Everyone understands how brave you are.)
- Dum deliberat secum quidnam fecisset, intervenit Iovis. (While she was thinking about what she had done with him, Jupiter intervened.)

To avoid the ambiguity regarding contemporaneous (present) and subsequent time (future) in indirect statement, indirect question use a **periphrastic future** to express future time. The periphrastic future consists of the future active participle of the verb and the present or imperfect subjunctive of sum (depending on sequence of tenses). This distinction can be seen below:

- Dico te quid **faciam**. (I am telling you what I am doing.)
- Dico te quid **facturus sim**. (I am telling you what I will do.)
- Dicebam te quid **facerem**. (I was telling you what I was doing.)
- Dicebam te quid **facturus essem**. (I was telling you what I would do.)

## Additional Practice

Identify all the constituent parts of the indirect questions in the sentence below and translate.

1. quaerebant ab rege quis donum ei dedisset.
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac1')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac1">"quaerebant = verb of the head, quis = interrogative (and subject), dedisset = subjunctive verb; They were asking the king who had given the gift to him."</span>

2. dubitabant ubi regina aurum posuisset.
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac2')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac2">"dubitabant = verb of the head, ubi = interrogative, regina = subject, posuisset = subjunctive verb; They were unsure when the queen had put the gold."</span>

3. Cur Cicero carmina scribere velit exponam.
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac3')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac3">"exponam = verb of the head, cur = interrogative, Cicero = subject, velit = subjunctive verb; I will explain why Cicero wants to write poetry."</span>
