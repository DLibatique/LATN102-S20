## Orders

There are a number of ways in which one can issue an order in Latin. An order commands someone to do something.

***

## Imperative Mood

The imperative is the third of three **moods** in Latin. We've had extensive practice with the primary two: the **indicative mood**, which is used for factual situations; and the **subjunctive mood**, which is used for non-factual situations (doubt, possibility, wish, etc.).

This third mood, the **imperative mood**, exists mostly in the 2nd person and issues an order from the speaker to the addressee. For example:

- **audī!** Listen! (to a singular addressee) (2nd sg. pres. imperative act.)
- **audīte!** Listen! (to a group of people) (2nd pl. pres. imperative act.)

The verbal action is a command being issued to the listener. The singular imperative commands a single person to do something; the plural imperative commands a group of people to do something.

To form the imperative of **1st, 2nd, and 4th conjugation verbs**:
- in the singular, simply chop the -re off the infinitive.
  - amāre - **amā!** "Love!"
  - sedēre - **sedē!** "Sit!"
  - audīre - **audī!** "Listen!"
- in the plural, add **-te** to the singular imperative form.
  - **amāte!** "Love!" (to a plural group)
  - **sedēte!** "Sit!"
  - **audīte!** "Listen!"

To form the imperative of **3rd and 3rd -iō conjugation verbs**:
- in the singular, chop the -re off the infinitive, as in the other conjugations:
  - regere - **rege!** "Rule!"
  - capere - **cape!** "Take!"
- but in the plural, change the stem vowel to **-i-** before adding the **-te**:
  - **regite!** "Rule!" (to a plural group)
  - **capite!** "Take!"

Take a look at the following examples.

- **epistulam scrībe!** Write the letter!
- **verba eius audīte!** Listen to his words!
- **dā mihi basia mille!** Give a thousand kisses to me! (Catullus 5.7)

### Irregular Imperatives

There are four verbs that have irregularly-formed singular imperatives:
- dīcere - **dīc!** "Speak!"
- dūcere - **dūc!** "Lead!"
- facere - **fac!** "Do! / Make!"
- ferre - **fer!** "Bring!"

Their plurals follow normal third and third -iō conjugation patterns, except for **ferre**:
- dīcere - **dīcite!** "Speak!"
- dūcere - **dūcite!** "Lead!"
- facere - **facite!** "Do! / Make!"
- ferre - **ferte!** "Bring!"

The imperative of the verb **eō, īre, iī/īvī, ītus** ("to go") is formed as follows:
- singular: **ī!** "Go!"
- plural: **īte!** "Go!"

***

### Negative Imperatives

To form a negative imperative, we use the imperative forms of **nōlō, nōlle, nōluī** with a **complementary infinitive**. The singular imperative of **nōlō** is **nōlī**; the plural imperative of **nōlō** is **nōlīte**.

- **nōlī timēre!** Don't be afraid!
- **nōlīte id aspicere.** Don't look at it!

***

## Negative Prohibition

Another way to express a negative command in the 2nd or 3rd person is to use a **perfect subjunctive** in an independent clause introduced by **nē**.

- **nē timuerīs!** Don't be afraid!
- **nē id aspexerītis!** Don't look at it!

It is more common, however, to use a [negative imperative](#negative-imperatives) to express a negative command.

5. haec nē dīxerīs!  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac5')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac5">Don't say these things!</span>

***

## Jussive Subjunctive

The jussive subjunctive is an **independent** use of the subjunctive (meaning it stands on its own in a clause and does not rely on a main clause) that expresses a command in the **third person**. Note the difference between the jussive subjunctive and the imperative: the latter gives an order directly to a listener (second person), while the jussive subjunctive gives an order to a third person entity (a "he," "she," "it," or "they").

Take a look at the following examples:

- **bona verba dīcat.** Let him say good words.
- **hanc linguam discant.** Let them learn this language.
- **ā marī veniat.** Let her come from the sea.

Jussives are negated with **nē**:

- **nē nōs videant.** Let them not see us.
- **nē id faciat.** Let him not do it.

***

## Hortatory Subjunctive

The hortatory subjunctive is an **independent** use of the subjunctive that expresses a command in the **first** person. Note the difference between the hortatory subjunctive and the jussive: the latter gives an order to a **third** person entity, while the hortatory subjunctive gives an order to a **first** person entity, often in the plural ("we" or "us"). For this reason, a nickname for the hortatory subjunctive is the "salad subjunctive" ("let us..." = "lettuce").

- **eāmus et ludum aspiciāmus.** Let us go and watch the game.
- **cēnam cum familiā nostrā habeāmus.** Let us have dinner with our family.
- **pulchrum carmen eōrum audiāmus.** Let us listen to their beautiful song.

Like the jussive, the hortatory is negated with **nē**:

- **nē canāmus.** Let us not sing.
- **nē eōs interficiāmus.** Let us not kill them.

## Indirect Command

All the methods of forming orders above (imperative, negative imperative, negative prohibition, jussive, hortatory) are **indepedendent clauses** and express a command directly to the person being ordered, whether 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person.

To express a command indirectly, or to filter it through a head verb of ordering (e.g., "He orders that...", "She commands that..."), we use a complex sentence structure called an **indirect command**. An indirect command utilizes:
1. a main verb of commanding, requesting, encouraging, advising, etc. (e.g., **imperō**, **hortor**, **moneō**, **rogō**),
2. the conjunction **ut** for a positive command or **nē** for a negative command,
3. and a clause with a **subjunctive** verb that follows the sequence of tenses.

- **imperō ut verba mea audiant.** I command that they listen to my words.
- **monuit nē mīles in urbem īret.** He advised that the soldier not go into the city.

Indirect commands often attract the person being commanded into the main clause as the **object of the main verb**. In such cases, we can translate the person commanded as the object of the main verb and the substance of the command as an infinitive. Take a look at the following examples:

- **hortātus est eam ut ad regem īret.** He encouraged her to go to the king.
- **rogāvit mē nē nōmen illud dīceret.** She asked me not to say that name.

Note that it is easy to mix up indirect commands with purpose clauses because of the conjunctions used (**ut**, **nē**). The key differences are in the action of the main verb and the question answered by the clause. If the main verb expresses some sort of command or request, it is likely to introduce an indirect command. Moreover, if the clause answers the question "why", it is probably a purpose clause; if it answers the question "what was commanded or requested?" it is probably an indirect command. Take a look at the following comparison:

- **ea imperāvit eī ut carmen audīret.** She ordered him to listen to the song.
- **is vēnit ut carmen audīret.** He came to listen to the song.

The first sentence contains an **indirect command** because the main verb indicates an action of commanding and the clause expresses the substance of that command (that he listen to the song). The second sentence, on the other hand, contains a **purpose clause** because the **ut** clause answers the question "why" or "for what purpose" did he come (in order to listen to the song). Here are some more comparisons:

- **monuimus eōs nē in urbem venīrent.** We advised them not to come into the city.
- **pontem perdidimus nē in urbem venīrent.** We destroyed the bridge so that they not come into the city.

- **rex nōs hortātur ut pecūniam eī dēmus.** The king encourages us to give money to him.
- **puer canere incipit ut pecūniam eī dēmus.** The boy begins to sing so that we might give money to him.
