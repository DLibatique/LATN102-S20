## Relative Clauses - Overview

**Relative clauses** are dependent clauses that tell us more about an **antecedent**, which is often a noun or pronoun. Such clauses function adjectivally; they modify the antecedent. Take a look at the following examples:

- The students **who studied for the exam** did well.
- The girl **whom I love** does not love me back.
- The teacher **whose students did well on the exam** was proud.
- I want the chair **which is not broken**.
- The ship **that we can see** does not look seaworthy.

Note that each relative clause is introduced by the word **who** (or its related words, like **whom** or **whose**), **which**, or **that**. Each relative clause describes an **antecedent**: which students? The ones who studied for the exam. Which girl? The one whom I love.

## Identifying Relative Clauses

In Latin, relative clauses are introduced by the **relative pronoun, quī, quae, quod ("who, which, that")**. This should hopefully be familiar to you from last semester -- it's the exact same entry as for the **interrogative adjective**. Last semester, we learned that forms of **quī, quae, quod**, when used as an interrogative adjective, modify an explicit noun in the sentence and ask a question: *quī puer?* Which boy? *quae puella?* Which girl?

Here, **quī, quae, quod** as a **relative pronoun** stands on its own and introduces a subordinate clause that contains its own verb and whatever else the verb governs (objects, subjects, prepositional phrases, etc.).

You can find the paradigm chart for the relative pronoun [here](pronoun-chart#relative).

Take a look at the following examples, with the relative clause, introduced by the relative pronoun, in bold:

- vīdimus virōs **quī ā nāvibus veniēbant**. We saw the men **who were coming from the ships**.
- exempla **quae magister mihi dedit** cognoscō. I recognize the examples **that the teacher gave to me.** (magister, magistrī, m. - teacher)
- rex fēminae **ā quā doctus erat** crēdidit. The king trusted the woman **by whom he had been taught**.

Again, the relative clause is a **dependent, subordinate clause**. It is usually introduced by the **relative pronoun** or the preposition that governs it (e.g., **ā** of **ā quā** in the third example), and it usually ends at the first conjugated verb that follows the relative pronoun. It is extremely important to sequester the relative clause so that you translate what belongs to the clause within the clause, without letting the main sentence creep in or vice versa.

In the sentence:

- exempla **quae magister mihi dedit** cognoscō. I recognize the examples **that the teacher gave to me**.

note that the core of the sentence is **exempla cognoscō**, "I recognize the examples." We can extract the relative clause without affecting the coherence of the main sentence. The relative clause simply serves to tell us more information about its antecedent. Which examples do I recognize? The ones that the teacher gave to me.

### Practice Opportunity 1

Identify the relative clause in the following sentences. Do not translate (unless you're feeling adventurous!).

## Gender, Number, and Case of Relative Pronouns

This is the most important rule when it comes to using relative pronouns in Latin: **the relative pronoun takes its** ***gender and number*** **from its antecedent, but it takes its** ***case*** **from its use within the relative clause**. As an illustration, take a look at this sentence again:

- vīdimus virōs **quī ā nāvibus veniēbant**. We saw the men **who were coming from the ships**.

According to our chart, the relative pronoun **quī** can be either masculine nominative singular or masculine nominative plural. Either way, it has to be the subject of its clause (because nominative), and the clause contains the plural verb **veniēbant**; therefore, **quī** must be **masculine nominative plural**. Within the relative clause "...who were coming from the ships", "who" / **quī**, our relative pronoun, serves as the subject of "were coming" / **veniēbant**, so it makes sense that that pronoun is nominative. The pronoun takes its case from its function within its clause.

Notice, however, that the antecedent of **quī** is **virōs**, which is **masculine accusative plural**. **quī** takes its **gender and number** (masculine and plural) but **NOT its case**. **quī** serves as the subject of the relative clause, but its antecedent **virōs** serves as the direct object of the main clause. Relative pronoun and antecedent share gender and number but not necessarily case. To put it differently:

**The relative takes its CASE from its PLACE in its own SPACE.**

Another example to illustrate this idea:

- rex fēminae **ā quā doctus erat** crēdidit. The king trusted the woman **by whom he had been taught**.

Our relative pronoun **quā** can only be one thing: feminine ablative singular. It is ablative because it is being used in an ablative of agent construction within the relative clause: "...**by whom** he had been taught." Its gender and number, feminine and singular, come from its antecedent, **fēminae**, which is being used as a dative object of **crēdidit** in the main clause.

### Practice Opportunity 2

In each of the following English sentences, identify the relative clause, and determine what case the relative pronoun would be in Latin according to its use within the clause. Do not translate into Latin (unless you feel adventurous!).

5. We were attacked by the sailors who came from the sea.

6. The citizens to whom we gave peace nevertheless did not trust us.

7. He slept near the river from which my family brought the water.

8. I don't trust the woman whose husband we recognized.

### Practice Opportunity 3

In each of the following sentences, parse the relative pronoun, identify and parse its antecedent, and then translate.

## Relative Clause of Characteristic

There are two **adverbial** uses of the relative clause. One, you will learn in the module on purpose clauses: [relative clauses of purpose](#). The other, you will learn now: **relative clauses of characteristic**.
