## Relative Clauses - Overview

**Relative clauses** are dependent clauses that tell us more about an **antecedent**, which is often a noun or pronoun. Such clauses function adjectivally; they modify the antecedent. Take a look at the following examples:

- The students **who studied for the exam** did well.
- The girl **whom I love** does not love me back.
- The teacher **whose students did well on the exam** was proud.
- I want the chair **which is not broken**.
- The ship **that we can see** does not look seaworthy.

Note that each relative clause is introduced by the word **who** (or its related words, like **whom** or **whose**), **which**, or **that**. Each relative clause describes an **antecedent**: which students? The ones who studied for the exam. Which girl? The one whom I love.

## Identifying Relative Clauses

In Latin, relative clauses are introduced by the **relative pronoun, quī, quae, quod ("who, which, that")**. This should hopefully be familiar to you from last semester -- it's the exact same entry as for the **interrogative adjective**. Last semester, we learned that forms of **quī, quae, quod**, when used as an interrogative adjective, modify an explicit noun in the sentence and ask a question: *quī puer?* Which boy? *quae puella?* Which girl?

Here, **quī, quae, quod** as a **relative pronoun** stands on its own and introduces a subordinate clause that contains its own verb and whatever else the verb governs (objects, subjects, prepositional phrases, etc.).

You can find the paradigm chart for the relative pronoun [here](pronoun-chart#relative).

Note also some special translations. The **genitive** of the relative pronoun usually indicates possession, so we can translate it as **"whose"**. Also, when a relative pronoun refers to a person, translations of oblique cases that indicate object status, like an accusative direct object or dative indirect object, will often use the form **"whom"**, since that is the objective form of the relative pronoun in English ("who" is subjective!).

Take a look at the following examples, with the relative clause, introduced by the relative pronoun, in bold:

- vīdimus virōs **quī ā nāvibus veniēbant**. We saw the men **who were coming from the ships**.
- exempla **quae magister mihi dedit** cognoscō. I recognize the examples **that the teacher gave to me.** (magister, magistrī, m. - teacher)
- rex fēminae **ā quā doctus erat** crēdidit. The king trusted the woman **by whom he had been taught**.

Again, the relative clause is a **dependent, subordinate clause**. It is usually introduced by the **relative pronoun** or the preposition that governs it (e.g., **ā** of **ā quā** in the third example), and it usually ends at the first conjugated verb that follows the relative pronoun. It is extremely important to sequester the relative clause so that you translate what belongs to the clause within the clause, without letting the main sentence creep in or vice versa.

In the sentence:

- exempla **quae magister mihi dedit** cognoscō. I recognize the examples **that the teacher gave to me**.

note that the core of the sentence is **exempla cognoscō**, "I recognize the examples." We can extract the relative clause without affecting the coherence of the main sentence. The relative clause simply serves to tell us more information about its antecedent. Which examples do I recognize? The ones that the teacher gave to me.

### Practice Opportunity 1

Identify the relative clause in the following sentences. Do not translate (unless you're feeling adventurous!).

## Gender, Number, and Case of Relative Pronouns

This is the most important rule when it comes to using relative pronouns in Latin: **the relative pronoun takes its** ***gender and number*** **from its antecedent, but it takes its** ***case*** **from its use within the relative clause**. As an illustration, take a look at this sentence again:

- vīdimus virōs **quī ā nāvibus veniēbant**. We saw the men **who were coming from the ships**.

According to our chart, the relative pronoun **quī** can be either masculine nominative singular or masculine nominative plural. Either way, it has to be the subject of its clause (because nominative), and the clause contains the plural verb **veniēbant**; therefore, **quī** must be **masculine nominative plural**. Within the relative clause "...who were coming from the ships", "who" / **quī**, our relative pronoun, serves as the subject of "were coming" / **veniēbant**, so it makes sense that that pronoun is nominative. The pronoun takes its case from its function within its clause. To put it differently:

**The relative takes its CASE from its PLACE in its own SPACE.**

Notice, however, that the antecedent of **quī** is **virōs**, which is **masculine accusative plural**. **quī** takes its **gender and number** (masculine and plural) but **NOT its case** from **virōs**. **quī** serves as the subject of the relative clause, but its antecedent **virōs** serves as the direct object of the main clause. Relative pronoun and antecedent share gender and number but not necessarily case.

Another example to illustrate this idea:

- rex fēminae **ā quā doctus erat** crēdidit. The king trusted the woman **by whom he had been taught**.

Our relative pronoun **quā** can only be one thing: feminine ablative singular. It is ablative because it is being used in an ablative of agent construction within the relative clause: **ā quā** doctus erat, "...**by whom** he had been taught." Its gender and number, feminine and singular, come from its antecedent, **fēminae**, which is being used as a dative object of **crēdidit** in the main clause.

### Practice Opportunity 2

In each of the following English sentences, identify the relative clause, and determine what **case and use** the relative pronoun would be in Latin according to its use within the clause. Do not translate into Latin (unless you feel adventurous!).

5. We were attacked by the sailors who had come from the sea.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac05')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac05">who had come from the sea; nominative, subject; ā nautīs quī ā marī vēnerant petitī sumus.</span>

6. The citizens to whom we gave peace nevertheless did not encourage us. (tamen - nevertheless)  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac06')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac06">to whom we gave peace; dative, indirect object; cīvēs quibus pacem dedimus tamen nōs nōn hortātī sunt.</span>

7. He slept near the river from which my family brought the water. (prope + acc. - near)  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac07')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac07">from which my family brought the water; ablative of motion from; prope flūmen ā quō familia mea aquam tulit dormīvit.</span>

8. I don't trust the woman whose husband we recognized.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac08')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac08">whose husband we recognized; genitive of possession; fēminae cuius maritum cognōvimus nōn crēdō.</span>

## Locating the Antecedent

The relative clause will often be located close to its antecedent, but sometimes it is not. For example, I could easily rewrite the sentence above as:

- rex fēminae crēdidit **ā quā doctus erat**.

When it isn't immediately clear what the antecedent of a relative pronoun is, you must use the **gender and number** of the relative pronoun to try to figure it out. **quā** is feminine singular, so we're looking for some noun, pronoun, or substantive adjective in the main clause that is feminine singular. The two nouns are **rex** and **fēminae**; of these two, the only possible choice is **fēminae** (as **rex** has to be masculine).

Even though the relative clause may be separated from its antecedent in Latin, in English, it makes more idiomatic sense to translate the relative clause immediately after its antecedent. For example, in the following Latin sentence:

- puer carmina cecinit quem docueram.

the relative clause **quem docueram** modifies the noun **puer**; antecedent and clause are separated by **carmina cecinit**. However, if we postpone the translation of the relative clause until the end, it sounds strange and, indeed, even confusing: "The boy sang songs **whom I had taught**." Because English relies on word order to make sense, we need to put the relative clause right after its antecedent: "The boy **whom I had taught** sang songs."

### Practice Opportunity 3

In each of the following sentences, parse the relative pronoun, identify and parse its antecedent, and then translate.

9. mīlitēs verba clamāvērunt quae nōs hortāta sunt. (clamō, -āre, -āvī, -ātus - to shout)  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac09')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac09">quae - neut. nom. pl.; verba - neut. acc. pl.; The soldiers shouted words which encouraged us.</span>

10. ā frātre sorōrēs creditae sunt quī hanc epistulam scripsit.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac10')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac10">quī - masc. nom. sg.; frātre - masc. abl. sg.; The sisters were believed by the brother who wrote this letter.</span>

11. rēgina regnum rexit in quō nōmina nostra cognoscuntur.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac11')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac11">quō - neut. abl. sg.; regnum - neut. acc. sg.; The queen ruled the kingdom in which our names are known.</span>

12. illī librī hīs puellīs legendī sunt quae discere volunt.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac12')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac12">quae - fem. nom. pl.; puellīs - fem. dat. pl.; Those books must be read by these girls who want to learn.</span>

## Connecting Relative

If a relative pronoun comes at the very beginning of a sentence, it is often being used as a **connecting relative**, an odd combination of a coordinating conjunction and a pronoun. Depending on the gender and number of the relative pronoun, it can be used to refer to an entity in the previous sentence or the whole idea encapsulated in the previous sentence, and it can sometimes be prefaced by "and", such that:

- **quī** = **et is**
- **quae** = **et ea**
- **quod** = **et id**

etc.

Take a look at the following examples:

- dux interfectus est. **quod** cum mīlitēs vīdissent, fūgērunt.
  - The leader was killed. **(And)** when the soldiers had seen **this**, they fled.
- frātrēs patrem suum vidēre voluērunt; **quem** cum vidēre possent, laetī erant.
  - The brothers wanted to see their father. **(And)** when they were able to see **him**, they were happy.

This **connecting relative** often, though not always, is used in a **cum** clause, and the **cum** is often postponed until after the connecting relative, as in the examples above. Note that the verbs in these examples are subjunctive because they are used in a **cum** clause to express the circumstances of the main verb; they are not subjunctive because of the relative pronoun. This is an important distinction to make once we consider in what circumstances a relative clause WOULD use a subjunctive verb, as in a relative clause of characteristic.

***

## Relative Clause of Characteristic

Most of the relative clauses that we've seen use indicative verbs because the clause is describing a definite antecedent. However, we can also use a **subjunctive verb** in the relative clause when the antecedent is **general, indefinite, interrogative, or negative**. This use of a relative clause with a subjunctive verb is called a **relative clause of characteristic**, because it defines a quality or characteristic of an antecedent that itself is general, indefinite, etc.

In translation, we can sometimes use the auxiliary verb "would" to render the subjunctive, and the antecedent can sometimes be prefaced by "the sort of" or "the kind of". We also often have to supply words in our translation based on, e.g., the gender and number of pronouns or nouns to help the translation make sense.

Take a look at the following examples:

- **quis est cui credāmus?** Who is there whom we would trust?
- **eī nōn sunt quī hoc faciant.** They are not the kind of people who would do this.
- **is erat quī veritātem dīceret**. He was the sort of guy who would speak the truth. (veritās, veritātis, f. - truth)
- **nēmō est quī hostem petere possit**. There is no one who can attack the enemy. (nēmō, neminis - nobody, no one)

### Practice Opportunity 4

Identify whether each of the following sentences uses a **relative clause of characteristic**, a **connecting relative**, or a straightforward **relative clause**. Then, translate.

13. haec est quae id putet.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac13')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac13">relative clause of characteristic; This is the kind of woman who would think this.</span>

14. haec est quae id putat.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac14')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac14">relative clause; This is the woman who thinks this.</span>

15. mīles pulcher est. quem cum vidērēmus, mirābāmur.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac15')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac15">connecting relative; The soldier is handsome. When we saw him, we marveled.</span>

16. mīles est quem mirēmur.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac16')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac16">relative clause of characteristic; The soldier is the kind of man whom we would marvel at.</span>
