## Relative Clauses

**Relative clauses** are dependent clauses that tell us more about an **antecedent**, which is often a noun or pronoun. This normally functions adjectivally in English. Take a look at the following examples:

- The students **who studied for the exam** did well.
- The girl **whom I love** does not love me back.
- The teacher **whose students did well on the exam** was proud.
- I want the chair **which is not broken**.
- The ship **that we can see** does not look seaworthy.

Note that each relative clause is introduced by the word **who** (or its related words, like **whom** or **whose**), **which**, or **that**.

### Practice Opportunity

There are two **adverbial** uses of the relative clause. One, you will learn in the module on purpose clauses: [relative clauses of purpose](#). The other, you will learn now: **relative clauses of characteristic**.
