## Relative Clauses - Overview

**Relative clauses** are dependent clauses that tell us more about an **antecedent**, which is often a noun or pronoun. This normally functions adjectivally in English. Take a look at the following examples:

- The students **who studied for the exam** did well.
- The girl **whom I love** does not love me back.
- The teacher **whose students did well on the exam** was proud.
- I want the chair **which is not broken**.
- The ship **that we can see** does not look seaworthy.

Note that each relative clause is introduced by the word **who** (or its related words, like **whom** or **whose**), **which**, or **that**. Each relative clause describes an **antecedent**: which students? The ones who studied for the exam. Which girl? The one whom I love.

## Formation in Latin

In Latin, relative clauses are introduced by the **relative pronoun, quī, quae, quod ("who, which, that")**. This should hopefully be familiar to you from last semester -- it's the exact same entry as for the **interrogative adjective**. Last semester, we learned that forms of **quī, quae, quod**, when used as an interrogative adjective, modify an explicit noun in the sentence and ask a question: *quī puer?* Which boy? *quae puella?* Which girl?

Here, **quī, quae, quod** as a **relative pronoun** stands on its own and introduces a subordinate clause that contains its own verb and whatever else the verb governs (objects, subjects, prepositional phrases, etc.).

### Practice Opportunity

## Relative Clause of Characteristic

There are two **adverbial** uses of the relative clause. One, you will learn in the module on purpose clauses: [relative clauses of purpose](#). The other, you will learn now: **relative clauses of characteristic**.
