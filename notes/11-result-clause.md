## Expressions of Result

In English, an expression of result tells us the result of the action of the main verb. Below are some basic examples and variations of expression of result (the expression of result is bolded):

- She was so smart **that even her teachers were awed by her intelligence**.
- He worked so hard **that he never slept.**
- She helped them with their homework **so that they could a good grade in the course**.

## Result Clauses

The most common way to express result in Latin is through a result clause. Result clauses are dependent clauses (i.e. they generally follow an independent clause) that have three key features:

- A subordinating conjunction (**ut**; NB: it is negated with non rather than ne)
- A subject (stated or implied)
- A verb in the present or imperfect subjunctive

In addition to these three key features, a result clause will be sometimes be preceded by an independent clause that features an adjective or adverb of degree such as tam, tantus, tālis, ita, sic, adeō, ūsque.

How do we translate a sentence containing result clause? Take the following example:

- Tantā irā conclamavērunt ut nēmo responderet.

First, we break the sentence into dependent (bolded) and independent clauses (italicized). In the case of a sentence containing a purpose clause, we can recognize the dependent clause rather easily as it begins with **ut**.

- *Tantā irā conclamavērunt* **ut nēmo responderet**.

We then translate the independent clause (notice the use of tantā in the dependent class):

- They shouted with such great anger **ut nēmo responderet**.

After that, we select the appropriate translation for the result clause based on the nature of its subject. If the subject of the result clause is the same as the subject of the independent clause, we can simply translate the **ut** plus the verb as "to *verb*" or "so as to *verb*". For example:

- Agricola laboravit ut domum aedicaret (The farmer worked to build a house).

If the subject of the purpose clause is different from that of the independent clause, we translate **ut** plus the verb as "so that [subject] *verbed*." This is the case with the example that we looked at above:

- *Tantā irā conclamavērunt* **ut nēmo responderet**.
- They shouted with such great anger that no one responded.
