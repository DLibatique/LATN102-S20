## Clauses of Proviso

If the action of the independent clause happens only under the particular circumstances described by the dependent clause, the dependent clause is referred to a **clause of proviso**. There are a number of words that can introduce clauses of proviso (dum, dummodo, modo), which usually are translated as "if only", "only", or "provided that." The clause of proviso always features a subjunctive verb in either the present or imperfect subjunctive. Clauses of proviso are negated by **ne**.

Below are some examples of proviso clauses (subjunctive verbs in the proviso clauses are bolded):

- Dum **metuant**, oderint. (So long as they are scared, let them be hateful)

- Magnō timore mē liberabis, dummodo inter me atque te murus **intersit**. (You will free me from great fear, so long as there is a wall between me and you).

- Erimus felices, modo ne **discedas**. (We will be happy, provided that you do not leave.)
