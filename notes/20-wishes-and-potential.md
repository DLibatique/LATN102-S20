## Independent Uses of the Subjunctive

Last semester, we learned that the subjunctive mood can be used either in **independent** clauses or **dependent** clauses. While the latter follows the sequence of tenses and wholly depends on a main clause for context, the former uses subjunctives in standalone sentences. The one independent use of the subjunctive that we learned about last semester was the **deliberative subjunctive**, which we use to indicate a deliberation about a question. For example, *quid dīcam*? "What should I say?"

To this, we will add two more independent uses of the subjunctive: the **optative** and the **potential**. (The remaining three independent uses of the subjunctive [jussive, hortatory, negative prohibition] are all covered in the module on [orders](orders).)

## Optative

The optative subjunctive expresses a **wish**. This wish could express something that the speaker hopes will happen in the future or something that the speaker wishes happened in the past (but didn't).

Optative subjunctives are often introduced by an adverb like **utinam** ("if only," "would that", "I wish that"). Optatives are negated by **utinam nē** ("if only ... not", "would that ... not", "I wish that ... not").

Wishes for a future action are indicated with the **present subjunctive** and are translated with the auxiliary verb "would [verb]":
- **utinam dīcat!** If only he would speak!
- **utinam nē mē videant!** If only they would not see me!

Wishes for a present action that is not coming to fruition are indicated with the **imperfect subjunctive** and are translated with the auxiliary verb: "were [verb]ing":
- **utinam venīret!** If only he were coming!
- **utinam nē hostēs fortēs essent!** If only the enemies weren't strong!

Wishes for a past action that did not come to fruition are indicated with the **pluperfect subjunctive** and are translated with the auxiliary verb "had [verb]ed"!
- **utinam domum vēnissēmus!** If only we had gone home!
- **utinam nē id vīdisset!** If only he hadn't seen it!
