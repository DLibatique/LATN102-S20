## Adjective Degrees - Overview

As we've discussed since the beginning of last semester, all adjectives have three aspects: **gender**, **case**, and **number**. To these three, we will now add a fourth: **degree**. The **degree** of the adjective indicates how much of that adjectival quality the noun described possesses, especially in relation to other nouns that also possess that quality. There are **three** degrees of adjectives:

- **positive**: the base level of an adjective
- **comparative**: a degree that indicates that the noun described possesses *more* of the adjectival quality than others. Often translated as "-er" or "more [adjective]."
- **superlative**: a degree that indicates that the noun described possesses the *most* of the adjectival quality of all nouns that possess it. Often translated as "-est" or "most [adjective]."

Most of the adjectives with which you've interacted so far are in the **positive** degree. Now, we will learn how to form the comparative and superlative degrees and also take into account irregular formations.

***

## Comparative Degree

The comparative degree indicates that the noun describes has **more** of the quality than another noun. As such, we can usually translate the comparative as the "-er" or "more" form of the adjective. Occasionally, we can also translate it as "rather [adjective]" or "too [adjective]."

To form the comparative degree of an adjective, get its stem according to the rules of its adjective type and add the endings **-ior** (M/F) and **-ius** (N) for the nominative forms. The oblique cases will then be based on the stem **-ior-**. Confusingly, each of these forms declines like a third declension **noun** rather than an adjective. Take a look at the declension chart below:

- **pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum** - handsome, beautiful (stem = pulchr-) > **pulchrior, pulchrius** - "more handsome, more beautiful"

**Singular**

| Case      | M./F. | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | pulchrior       | pulchrius       |
| Genitive   | pulchrior-**is**        | pulchrior-**is**  |
| Dative   | pulchrior-**ī**       | pulchrior-**ī**  |
| Accusative   | pulchrior-**em**        | pulchrius  |
| Ablative   | pulchrior-**e**        | pulchrior-**e**  |

**Plural**

| Case      | M./F. | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | pulchrior-**ēs**       | pulchrior-**a**       |
| Genitive   | pulchrior-**um**        | pulchrior-**um**  |
| Dative   | pulchrior-**ibus**        | pulchrior-**ibus**  |
| Accusative   | pulchrior-**ēs**        | pulchrior-**a**  |
| Ablative   | pulchrior-**ibus**        | pulchrior-**ibus**  |

Note the forms that decline like third declension nouns rather than adjectives: we might expect, for example, an ending of **-ia** in the neuter nominative and accusative plural, but that is not the case (the ending is simply **-a**). Like any other adjective, however, comparatives must agree with the noun that they describe in gender, case, and number:
- **mīlitēs fortiōrēs erant.** The soldiers were braver.
- **scīmus matrem nostram sapientiōrem nōbīs esse.** We know that our mother is wiser than us. (see below for "than us")
- **iter longius erit.** The journey will be rather long.

### Comparison with *quam* and Ablative of Comparison

The comparative degree compares how much of an adjectival quality one noun possesses over another. For example, in the following English sentence:

- This boy is more handsome than that boy.

we are comparing how handsome "this boy" is **than** "that boy." Note my use of the word "than" here -- this word indicates a comparison between two nouns. In Latin, we can use the word **quam** to indicate "than", and the two nouns being compared must be in the same case:

- **hic puer pulchrior est** ***quam ille puer***. This boy is more handsome *than that boy*.
- **mīles fortior erat** ***quam rex ipse***. The soldier is braver *than the king himself*.
- **dīcit magistrum sapientiorem esse** ***quam discipulum***. He says that the teacher is wiser *than the student*.

When the noun described by the comparative adjective is in the nominative or accusative, we can put the noun being compared against it into the **ablative** case and omit the **quam** entirely. We will thus supply "than" in our translation, since it's built into the ablative. This construction is called the **ablative of comparison**. Here are the sentences from above using the ablative of comparison rather than **quam**:

- **hic puer pulchrior est** ***puerō***. This boy is more handsome *than that boy*.
- **mīles fortior erat** ***rege ipsō***. The soldier is braver *than the king himself*.
- **dīcit magistrum sapientiorem esse** ***discipulō***. He says that the teacher is wiser *than the student*.

***

## Superlative Degree

The superlative degree of an adjective indicates that the noun described has the **most** of the adjectival quality of anyone that possesses that quality. So, we can usually translate it as the "-est" or "most" form of the adjective. Occasionally, we can translate the superlative as "very [adjective]."

To form the superlative degree of an adjective, add the endings **-issimus, -issima, -issimum** to the stem and decline it as a regular 2-1-2 adjective:

- longus, -a, -um, "long" > longior, longius, "longer" > **longissimus, -a, -um**, "longest"
- sapiēns, sapientis, "wise" > sapientior, sapientius, "wiser" > **sapientissimus, -a, -um**, "wisest"
- fortis, -e, "brave, strong" > fortior, fortius, "braver, stronger" > **fortissimus, -a, -um**, "bravest, strongest"

Again, like any other adjective, a superlative adjective must agree with its noun in gender, case, and number:
- **hostēs ā fortissimīs mīlitibus victī sunt.** The enemies were defeated by the bravest soldiers.
- **dīxit illās sapientissimās esse.** He said that those women were the wisest.
- **iter longissimum erat.** The journey was very long.

### Superlative with *quam*

We can also use **quam** with a superlative to indicate "as [adjective] as possible":

- **hic vir** ***quam sapientissimus*** **est**. This man is *as wise as possible*.
- **dīxit hostem** ***quam ferocissimum*** **esse**. He said that the enemy was *as fierce as possible*.

***

## Irregular Comparative and Superlative Adjectives

There are a number of adjective classes that form their comparative and superlative degrees irregularly.

### Superlatives for -er and -lis Adjectives

If the masculine nominative singular positive form of an adjective ends in -er (e.g., **pulcher**, pulchra, pulchrum; **acer**, acris, acre) or in -lis (e.g., **facilis**, -e, "easy"; **similis**, -e, "similar"), the superlative is not formed regularly.

For -er adjectives, you must take the entire masculine nominative singular positive form, duplicate the final consonant, and then add the endings **-imus, -ima, -imum**. For example:

- pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum, "beautiful, handsome" > pulchrior, pulchrius, "more beautiful, more handsome" > pulcher + r + imus = **pulcherrimus, -a, -um**, "most beautiful, most handsome"
- acer, acris, acre, "sharp" > acrior, acrius, "more sharp" > acer + r + imus = **acerrimus, -a, -um**, "most sharp"

**pulcherrimum virum in urbe vīdimus.** We saw the most handsome man in the city.  
**petitī sunt ab acerrimīs mīlitibus.** They were attacked by the fiercest soldiers.  

For -lis adjectives, you must take the *stem* of the adjective, duplicate the final -l, and then add **-imus, -ima, -imum**. For example:

- facilis, -e, "easy" > facilior, facilius, "easier" > facil + l + imus = **facillimus, -a, -um**, "easiest"
- similis, -e, "similar" > similior, similius, "more similar" > simil + l + imus = **simillimus, -a, -um**, "most similar"

**puerī facillima carmina canēbant.** The boys were singing the easiest songs.  
**amīcus meus simillimus mihi est.** My friend is very similar to me.  

### Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

Some adjectives have completely irregular changes from the positive to the comparative to the superlative degree and simply must be memorized. Here is a chart of irregular comparatives and superlatives and some notes on specific forms.

| Positive      | Comparative | Superlative |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| bonus, -a, -um, "good"    | melior, melius, "better"       | optimus, -a, -um, "best"       |
| magnus, -a, -um, "big"   | maior, maius, "bigger"        | maximus, -a, -um, "biggest"  |
| malus, -a, -um, "bad"   | pēior, pēius, "worse"     | pessimus, -a, -um, "worst" |
| multus, -a, -um, "much; many"   | \*plūs, plūris, "more"       | plūrimus, -a, -um, "most"  |
| parvus, -a, -um, "small"   | minor, minus, "smaller"        | minimus, -a, -um, "smallest, least"  |
| \*\*(none) | prior, prius, "former, previous" | prīmus, -a, -um, "first" |
| superus, -a, -um, "upper"   | superior, superius, "higher"        | summus, -a, -um, "highest, furthest; top of"; suprēmus, -a, -um, "highest, last"  |

\* **plūs, plūris** is an odd form that acts like a **third declension neuter noun in the singular** but an **irregular third declension adjective in the plural**.

**Singular**

| Case      | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | plūs       |
| Genitive   | plūris  |
| Dative   | (no dative form)  |
| Accusative   | plūs  |
| Ablative   | plūre  |

Because the singular acts as a noun, it cannot modify another noun. As a result, this noun often takes a construction called the **partitive genitive**, a genitive noun that indicates what there is more of. For example:
- **plūs pecūniae habēmus.** We have more money. (literally, "We have more of money.")

**Plural**

| Case      | M./F. | Neuter |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Nominative    | plūrēs       | **plūra**       |
| Genitive   | plūrium        | plūrium  |
| Dative   | plūribus       | plūribus  |
| Accusative   | plūrēs        | **plūra**  |
| Ablative   | plūribus        | plūribus  |

Note that the plural forms are adjectives that must agree with a noun in gender, case, and number (e.g., **plūrēs mīlitēs**, "more soldiers"; **plūrium carminum**, "of more songs"), but the neuter nominative and accusative plural do not have the expected -ia ending; instead, the ending is simply **-a**.

\*\* **prior** and **prīmus** do not have a positive degree, since their very definitions ("previous" and "first" respectively) necessarily are comparative and superlative in nature; something cannot be "previous" without being "previous" to something else.

## Adverb Degrees - Overview

Adverbs, like adjectives, have a degree: positive, comparative, or superlative. The same relationships apply: positive is the base degree of an adverb, comparative corresponds to "more", and superlative corresponds to "most." For example:

- He sang **beautifully**. She sang **more beautifully**. But they sang **most beautifully**.

Some adverbs are indeclinable forms and have only positive degrees (e.g., **nōn**, "not"). However, we can also use adjectives to create adverbs in each of the three degrees.

To form the positive degree of an adverb from an adjective:
- if a 2-1-2, add **-ē** to the stem:
  - pulcher, pulchra, pulchrum, "beautiful" > **pulchrē**, "beautifully"
  - laetus, -a, -um, "happy" > **laetē**, "happily"
- if a third declension adjective, add **-iter** to the stem, unless the stem ends in **-nt-**, in which case add only **-er**:
  - ferox, ferocis, "fierce" > **ferociter**, "fiercely"
  - acer, acris, acre, "sharp" > **acriter**, "sharply"
  - sapiēns, sapientis, "wise" > **sapienter**, "wisely"

**magister discipulōs sapienter docuit.** The teacher taught the students wisely.  
**familia laetē cēnam parāvit.** The family happily prepared dinner.  

Note also that the **neuter nom./acc. sg.** form of an adjective can often be used as an adverb:
- **is illa carmina** ***facile*** **didicit**. He learned those songs **easily**.
- **tē multum amō**. I love you **much**.

The comparative degree of an adjective-derived adverb almost always exactly corresponds to the neuter nom./acc. sg. comparative form of the adjective:
- **pulchrius**, "more beautifully"
- **laetius**, "more happily"
- **ferocius**, "more fiercely"
- **acrius**, "more sharply"
- **sapientius**, "more wisely"

**mīlitēs nostrī ferocius quam illī pugnāvērunt**. Our soldiers fought more fiercely than those (soldiers).  
**ea carmina pulchrius quam is canit.** She is singing the songs more beautifully than he (is).  

The superlative degree of an adjective-derived adverb is formed by adding **-ē** to the superlative adjective stem:
- **pulcherrimē**, "most beautifully"
- **laetissimē**, "most happily"
- **ferocissimē**, "most fiercely"
- **acerrimē**, "most sharply"
- **sapientissimē**, "most wisely"

**sapientissimē dīxit.** He spoke very wisely.  
**virī ferocissimē clamāvērunt.** The men shouted most fiercely.  

Note that comparative and superlative adverbs can also be used with **quam** to indicate "than" or "as [adverb] as possible" respectively, similar to its use with comparative and superlative adjectives. The ablative of comparison is not usually used with comparative adverbs.

### Irregular Adverbs

While many adverbs formed from irregular adjectives follow the same rules of formation as above, some forms, including positive degree forms, are irregular. Check out the following chart, with irregular or unexpected forms in bold.

| Positive      | Comparative | Superlative |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| **bene**, "well"    | melius, "better"       | optimē, "best"       |
| **multum**, "much" | plūs, "more" (quantity) | **plūrimum**, "most, very much" |
| **magnopere**, "greatly"   | **magis**, "more" (quality)       | maximē, "most, especially"  |
| **parum**, "little, not very much"   | minus, "less" (quality)        | minimē, "least"  |
| (none) | prius, "before, earlier" | **prīmō**, "first (in time), at first"; **prīmum**, "first (in a series), in the first place" |
| **diū**, "for a long time"   | **diūtius**, "longer"        | **diūtissimē**, "longest, very long"  |
