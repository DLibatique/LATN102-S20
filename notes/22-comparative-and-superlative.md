## Adjective Degrees - Overview

As we've discussed since the beginning of last semester, all adjectives have three aspects: **gender**, **case**, and **number**. To these three, we will now add a fourth: **degree**. The **degree** of the adjective indicates how much of that adjectival quality the noun described possesses, especially in relation to other nouns that also possess that quality. There are **three** degrees of adjectives:

- **positive**: the base level of an adjective
- **comparative**: a degree that indicates that the noun described possesses *more* of the adjectival quality than others. Often translated as "-er" or "more [adjective]."
- **superlative**: a degree that indicates that the noun described possesses the *most* of the adjectival quality of all nouns that possess it. Often translated as "-est" or "most [adjective]."

Most of the adjectives with which you've interacted so far are in the **positive** degree. Now, we will learn how to form the comparative and superlative degrees and also take into account irregular formations.
