## Conditionals - Overview

Conditional clauses are dependent clauses that indicate what happens **if** something else occurs. We might

Conditions are composed of two clauses:
- a dependent **protasis** (the "if" clause)
- the main **apodosis** (the "then" clause)

For example:

If we study for the exam, we will get good grades.

"If we study for the exam" is the **protasis**, while "we will get good grades" is the **apodosis**.

Protases are usually introduced by the subordinating conjunction **sī**, "if", or **nisī**, "if ... not" or "unless".

## Conditionals Chart

The following chart indicates the six types of conditions that they are in Latin. This is meant as a summary and a convenient study aid that collects all the possibilities in one place. The remaining sections of this module will explain each condition in detail and the guidelines for the formation and translation of each.

| **Conjunction**  | **Protasis**  |  **Apodosis** | **Condition Type**  | **Translation**  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| sī/nisī  | past indicative  | past indicative  | **past simple**  | translate normally  |
| sī/nisī  | present indicative  | present indicative  | **present simple**  | translate normally  |
| sī/nisī  | future or future perfect indicative  |  future or future perfect indicative |  **future more vivid / future simple** | translate normally; optionally, translate protasis as present tense  |
| sī/nisī  | pluperfect subjunctive  | pluperfect subjunctive  | **past contrary-to-fact**  | "had / would have"  |
| sī/nisī  | imperfect subjunctive  | imperfect subjunctive  | **present contrary-to-fact**  | "were / would"  |
| sī/nisī  | present (or perfect) subjunctive  | present subjunctive  | **future less vivid**  | "should / would"  |

For the following examples, we will use the same sentence to illustrate how each of the different conditionals works:

"If he does it, he is wise."

## Indicative Conditionals

Conditionals that use the indicative mood in both clauses express general truths; for that reason, they are often called **general conditions**. We can always translate an indicative verb at face value depending on its tense: for example, if you see an imperfect tense indicative verb, translate it as a straightforward imperfect. There will be some options for translation when it comes to the future more vivid.

### Past Simple

A past simple condition uses past tenses in the indicative in both the protasis and apodosis and explains a general truth about an action in the past. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question were actually performed.

- sī id fēcit, sapiēns erat. If he did it, he was wise.
- sī id faciēbat, sapiēns erat. If he was doing it, he was wise.
- sī id fēcerat, sapiēns erat. If he had done it, he was wise.

### Present Simple

A present simple condition uses the present tense in the indicative in both clauses to explain a general truth in the present. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question are actually happening.

- sī id facit, sapiēns est. If he does / is doing it, he is wise.

### Future More Vivid / Future Simple

The future more vivid or future simple condition uses either the future or the future perfect tense in both clauses to indicate a general truth in the future. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question will actually happen; there is no doubt.

- sī id faciet, sapiēns erit. If he will do it, he will be wise.
- sī id fēcerit, sapiēns erit. If he will have done it, he will be wise.

Note that with the future more vivid, you have the option of translating the verb in the protasis, whether it's future or future perfect, as a **present** tense:

- sī id faciet, sapiēns erit. If he does this, he will be wise.

In this case, using a present tense to translate the apodosis contributes to the generalizing quality of the condition; it also sounds better in English, especially if the verb in your protasis is in the future perfect, the translation of which usually sounds stilted and odd in modern English.

## Subjunctive Conditionals

Two conditions that use the subjunctive indicate actions that would have happened upon the enactment of some condition; however, that condition was not met, so the entire condition is just a thought experiment that is contrary to what factually happened or is happening. A third condition that uses the subjunctive indicates an action that may occur in the future contingent upon the completion of a condition, but it's uncertain whether it will happen.

### Past Contrary-to-Fact

A past contrary-to-fact (or "past contrafactual") condition indicates what **would have** happened **if** something **had** happened. Both clauses will use the pluperfect subjunctive.

The protasis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive straightforwardly: "had [verb]ed".

The apodosis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive with the auxiliaries "would have [verb]ed."

- sī id fēcisset, sapiēns fuisset. If he had done it, he would have been wise

### Present Contrary-to-Fact

### Future Less Vivid
