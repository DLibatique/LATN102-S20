## Conditionals - Overview

Conditional clauses are dependent clauses that indicate what happens **if** something else occurs. We might

Conditions are composed of two clauses:
- a dependent **protasis** (the "if" clause)
- the main **apodosis** (the "then" clause)

For example:

If we study for the exam, we will get good grades.

"If we study for the exam" is the **protasis**, while "we will get good grades" is the **apodosis**.

Protases are usually introduced by the subordinating conjunction **sī**, "if", or **nisī**, "if ... not" or "unless".

## Conditionals Chart

The following chart indicates the six types of conditions that they are in Latin. This is meant as a summary and a convenient study aid that collects all the possibilities in one place. The remaining sections of this module will explain each condition in detail and the guidelines for the formation and translation of each.

| **Conjunction**  | **Protasis**  |  **Apodosis** | **Condition Type**  | **Translation**  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| sī/nisī  | past indicative  | past indicative  | **past simple**  | translate normally  |
| sī/nisī  | present indicative  | present indicative  | **present simple**  | translate normally  |
| sī/nisī  | future or future perfect indicative  |  future or future perfect indicative |  **future more vivid / future simple** | translate normally; optionally, translate protasis as present tense  |
| sī/nisī  | pluperfect subjunctive  | pluperfect subjunctive  | **past contrary-to-fact**  | "had / would have"  |
| sī/nisī  | imperfect subjunctive  | imperfect subjunctive  | **present contrary-to-fact**  | "were / would"  |
| sī/nisī  | present (or perfect) subjunctive  | present subjunctive  | **future less vivid**  | "should / would"  |

For the following examples, we will use the same sentence to illustrate how each of the different conditionals works:

"If he does it, he is wise."

## Indicative Conditionals

Conditionals that use the indicative mood in both clauses express general truths; for that reason, they are often called **general conditions**. We can always translate an indicative verb at face value depending on its tense: for example, if you see an imperfect tense indicative verb, translate it as a straightforward imperfect. There will be some options for translation when it comes to the future more vivid.

### Past Simple

A past simple condition uses past tenses in the indicative in both the protasis and apodosis and explains a general truth about an action in the past. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question were actually performed.

- sī id fēcit, sapiēns erat. If he did it, he was wise.
- sī id faciēbat, sapiēns erat. If he was doing it, he was wise.
- sī id fēcerat, sapiēns erat. If he had done it, he was wise.

### Present Simple

A present simple condition uses the present tense in the indicative in both clauses to explain a general truth in the present. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question are actually happening.

- sī id facit, sapiēns est. If he does / is doing it, he is wise.

### Future More Vivid / Future Simple

The future more vivid or future simple condition uses either the future or the future perfect tense in both clauses to indicate a general truth in the future. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question will actually happen; there is no doubt.

- sī id faciet, sapiēns erit. If he will do it, he will be wise.
- sī id fēcerit, sapiēns erit. If he will have done it, he will be wise.

Note that with the future more vivid, you have the option of translating the verb in the protasis, whether it's future or future perfect, as a **present** tense:

- sī id faciet, sapiēns erit. If he does this, he will be wise.

In this case, using a present tense to translate the apodosis contributes to the generalizing quality of the condition; it also sounds better in English, especially if the verb in your protasis is in the future perfect, the translation of which usually sounds stilted and odd in modern English.

### Practice Opportunity 1

Identify the type of condition contained in each of the following sentences and translate.

1. tē nōn vidēbimus nisī in domō manēbis.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac1')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac1">future more vivid / future simple: "We will not see you unless you (will) remain in the house." / "We will not see you if you do / will not remain in the house."</span>

2. sī illud dīxit, mentītus est. (mentior, -īrī, -ītus sum - to lie)      
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac2')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac2">past simple: "If he said that, he lied."</span>

3. ea canere vult sī carmina discere potest.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac3')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac3">present simple: "She wants to sing if she can learn the songs."</span>

## Subjunctive Conditionals

Two conditions that use the subjunctive indicate actions that would have happened upon the enactment of some condition; however, that condition was not met, so the entire condition is just a thought experiment that is contrary to what factually happened or is happening. A third condition that uses the subjunctive indicates an action that may occur in the future contingent upon the completion of a condition, but it's uncertain whether it will happen.

### Past Contrary-to-Fact

A past contrary-to-fact (or "past contrafactual") condition indicates what **would have** happened **if** something **had** happened. Both clauses will use the **pluperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive straightforwardly: "had [verb]ed".

The apodosis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive with the auxiliaries "would have [verb]ed."

- sī id fēcisset, sapiēns fuisset. If he had done it, he would have been wise.

### Present Contrary-to-Fact

A present contrary-to-fact (or "present contrafactual") condition indicates what **would** happen **if** something **were** happening. Both clauses will use the **imperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary "were [verb]ing."

The apodosis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary "would [verb]."

- sī id faceret, sapiēns esset. If he were doing it, he would be wise.

### Future Less Vivid

The future less vivid condition indicates an action that **would** happen in the future, if another action **should** happen first. Both clauses will use the **present subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary "should [verb]."

The apodosis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary "would [verb]."

- sī id faciat, sapiēns sit. If he should do it, he would be wise.

Note that the translation of the apodosis is the same as the apodosis of a present contrary-to-fact; the difference lies in the time when the action of the protasis would be completed: in the present for a present contrary-to-fact; in the future for a future less vivid.

Rarely, you may see a perfect subjunctive instead of a present subjunctive in the protasis:

- sī id fēcerit, sapiēns sit. If he should do it, he would be wise.

### Practice Opportunity 2

Identify the type of condition in each of the following sentences and translate.

4. nostrī mīlitēs hostem vicissent sī eī acrēs fuissent.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac4')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac4">past contrary-to-fact: "Our soldiers would have defeated the enemy if they had been fierce."</span>

5. nostrī mīlitēs hostem vincant sī eī acrēs sint.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac5')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac5">future less vivid: "Our soldiers would conquer the enemy if they should be fierce."</span>

6. nostrī mīlitēs hostem vincerent sī eī acrēs essent.  
<button onclick="toggleDisplay('prac6')">Click here to toggle the answer:</button> <span style="display: none;" id="prac6">present contrary-to-fact: "Our soldiers would conquer the enemy if they were fierce."</span>

## Mixed Conditions

A condition may be composed of different types of protases and apodoses or, sometimes, even entire other grammatical constructions like [hortatory subjunctives](orders#hortatory-subjunctive) or [imperatives](orders#imperative-mood). In such cases, analyze each half of the condition on its own terms and translate accordingly before putting the two halves together. For example:

- sī haec verba dīxisset, laetus essem.

The protasis of this mixed condition uses a pluperfect subjunctive verb: that makes it the protasis of a past contrary-to-fact, translated as "had [verb]ed."  The apodosis, on the other hand, uses an *imperfect* subjunctive verb: that makes it the apodosis of a present contrary-to-fact, translated as "would [verb]." When we put the two halves together, we come up with the following translation:

- If he had said these words, I would be happy.

You can also use other grammatical structures in place of an apodosis, such as a command:

- sī hoc dīcat, domum eāmus. If he should say this, let us go home. (hortatory subjunctive)
- sī legēs mutāre velīs, epistulam scrībe! If you should want to change the laws, write a letter! (imperative mood verb)

Note also that ablative absolutes can also be translated as conditionals, if such a translation makes sense in the context of the narrative:

- hostibus ā mīlitibus nostrīs victīs, incolumēs fuissēmus. If the enemies had been conquered by our soldiers, we would have been safe. (ablative absolute replacing the protasis of a past contrary-to-fact)
