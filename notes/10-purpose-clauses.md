## Expressions of Purpose

In English, an expression of purpose tells us what is intended by a particular course of action. Below are some basic examples and variations of expression of purpose (the expression of purpose is bolded):

- He got up at 9 AM **to get to class on time**.
- He got up at 9 AM **so that he could get to class on time**.
- He got up at 9 AM **so as to get to class on time**.
- He got up at 9 AM **to not be late to class**.

There are two things worth noting about expressions of purpose. First, they are dependent on a previous verbal construction. Second, the verbal action contained in the expression of purpose always happens after the verbal construction on which they are dependent. In other words, they have a sense of futurity to them.

As you will see below, Latin has a number of ways to express purpose.  

## Purpose Clauses

The most common way to express purpose in Latin is through a purpose clause. Purpose clauses are dependent clauses (i.e. they generally follow an independent clause) that have three key features:

- A subordinating conjunction (**ut** or its negation **ne**)
- A subject (stated or implied)
- A verb in the present or imperfect subjunctive

How do we translate a sentence containing purpose clause? Take the following example:

- Ad agrōs militēs venērunt ut urbem peterent.

First, we break the sentence into dependent (bolded) and independent clauses (italicized). In the case of a sentence containing a purpose clause, we can recognize the dependent clause rather easily as it begins with **ut** or **ne**.

- *Ad agrōs militēs venērunt* **ut urbem peterent**.

We then translate the independent clause:

- The soldiers came to the fields **ut urbem peterent**.

After that, we select the appropriate translation for the purpose clause based on the nature of its subject. If the subject of the purpose clause is the same as the subject of the independent clause, we can simply translate the **ut** plus the verb as "to *verb*" or "in order to *verb*" (in case of **ne**, "to *not verb*"). In the case of the sentence above, this is the case and we can translate it as follows:

- The soldiers came to the fields to attack the city.
- The soldiers came to the fields in order to attack the city.

If the subject of the purpose clause is different from that of the independent clause, we translate **ut** plus the verb as "so that [subject] could *verb*." We can see this in the example below:

- *Ad agrōs militēs venērunt* **ut urbem dux peteret**.
- The soldiers came to the fields so that the leader could attack the city.

## Practice Opportunities

## Relative Clause of Purpose

A variation on the standard purpose clause is known as the relative clause of purpose. In a relative clause of purpose, the ut or ne is replaced by a **relative pronoun** (i.e. quī, quae, quod) or **relative adverb** (i.e. ubi, unde). We can differentiate a relative clause of purpose from a regular relative clause by the use of the subjunctive:

- *Ad agrōs militēs venērunt* **qui urbem peterent**.
- They send soldiers to the fields to attack the city
- They send soldiers to the fields who were to attack the city.

## GRGs with Prepositions

Last semester, we learned about how gerund-replacing-gerundives (click [here](https://libatique.info/LATN101-F19/notes/4-verbal-nouns-and-adjs/#grgs-gerund-replacing-gerundives) to review) can be used express a verbal action and the object which receives the action. The GRG can also be used as the object of the prepositions *ad (in the accusative)* and *causā/gratiā (in the genitive)* to express purpose.

Thus, our example sentence can be written in the following ways as well:

- Ad agrōs militēs venērunt **ad petendam urbem**. (The soldiers came to the fields **for the purpose of attacking the city/to attack the city**.)
- Ad agrōs militēs venērunt **petendae urbis causā**. (The soldiers came to the fields **for the sake of attacking the city/to attack the city**.)

NB: GRGs take their case from their function in the sentence, but their gender and number from their object.

## Future Active Participles

As we noted a few weeks ago, participles or verbal adjectives play a large number of roles in Latin. One of these roles is as a way to express purpose. We use the future active participle (click here [] to review), which naturally indicates future intent ("about to *verb*"), to express purpose. When translating the future active participle as an expression of purpose, it is important to remember that participles modify nouns and, thus, it will be the noun modified by the participle that will be acting with a particular purpose in mind.

To follow up on our example again:

- Ad agrōs militēs **petituri urbem** venērunt. (The soldiers, **intending to attack the city**, came to the field.)

## The Supine

The last and least common way to express purpose in Latin is by using the supine. The supine is weird verbal noun whose origin is not very well understood. However, it is very closely related to the fourth principal part and exists in only two cases: the accusative and the ablative. We form the accusative supine by dropping the -us from the fourth principal part and add a -um and the ablative supine (e.g. amatus becomes **amatum** in the accusative and **amatu** in the ablative).

The accusative supine is used with only a verb of motion to express purpose (we will learn about the ablative supine later). Here our example sentence using the supine:

- Ad agrōs militēs **petitum urbem** venērunt. (The soldiers came to the field to attack the city.)

## Additional Practice

Find the phrase that expresses purpose in the sentence and identify the Latin construction. Then, translate.
