## Concessive Clauses

Concessive clauses are dependent clauses that indicate that the action of the dependent clause happens despite circumstances that appear to hinder it. There are a number of words that can introduce concessive clauses (quamvis, licet, quamquam, cum), which usually are translated as "although", "even thought", or "and yet." Additionally, there are certain words that appear in the independent clause, such as **tamen** ("nevertheless"), that indicate that its action are at odds with the circumstances of the dependent clause These clauses can take either the indicative or the subjunctive.

**Quamquam** (although) always takes the indicative and introduces an admitted fact.

- Quamquam senex non fortis erat, tamen magnā sapientiā regnavit. (Although the old man was not strong, he nevertheless ruled with great wisdom.)

**Quamvis** (although, lit. as much as you wish) always takes the subjunctive.

- Quamvis difficilis esset, tamen linguam Latinam facile didicit. (Although it was difficult, she nevertheless learned the Latin language easily.)

**Licet** (although, lit. it is granted) is used with the present or perfect subjunctive.

- Licet omnēs horribilēs mē petiverint, Roma valet. (Although all the horrible things attack me, Rome remains strong.)

**Cum clauses** that feature a subjunctive verb can indicate concession. In these cases, we translate cum as "although." Frequently

- Cum puerum amaret, tamen ex urbe abiit. (Although he loved the girl, he nevertheless left the city.)

Note in the sentence above, it would not make any sense if you translate it as "although."

Once again, if there is a concessive clause in indirect statement, the concessive clause will always have a subjunctive verb.
