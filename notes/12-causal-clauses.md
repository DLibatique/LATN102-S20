## Causal Clauses

Causal clauses are dependent clauses that explain why the action of the dependent clause happens. There are a number of words that can introduce causal clauses (quod, quia, quoniam, cum). These clauses can take either the indicative or the subjunctive.

**Quod** and **quia** can be used with the indicative or the subjunctive. When used with the indicative, quod and quia indicate that the stated cause is true in the eyes of the sentence's writer or speaker. They use the subjunctive to indicate that the stated cause is true in the eyes of someone who is *not* the writer or speaker.

- pācem nolō quod difficilis est. (I do not want peace because (to my mind) it is difficult.)
- pācem noluit quod difficilis esset. (He does not want peace because (to his mind) it is difficult.)

NB: Quod can be differentiated from the relative pronoun quite easily. If there is no neuter singular antecedent, then quod cannot be a pronoun.

**Quoniam** is used almost solely with the indicative to introduce a cause in the eyes of the writer or speaker.

- Quoniam puellam amat, mittere eum ad bellum nolo. (Because he loves the girl, I do not wish to send him to war.)

**Cum clauses** that feature a subjunctive verb can indicate cause. In these cases, we translate cum as "because.""

- Cum puellam amaret, fortiter pugnavit. (Because he loved the girl, he fought bravely.)

Note in the sentence above, it would not make any sense if you translate it as "when."

If there is a causal clause in indirect statement, the causal clause will always have a subjunctive verb. Can you think of reason why this might be the case?
