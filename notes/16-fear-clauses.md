## Fear Clauses

If the subject of an independent is/was fearful that some type of verbal action is/was going to occur, in Latin the action that they are afraid of is expressed as dependent clause. The dependent clause is usually referred to as a fear clause. A fear clause always follows an independent clause that contains a verb of fearing (timeō, vereor, metuō, terreor) and is introduced by **ne** (NB: when a verb of fearing is followed by **ut**, it is a negative fear clause). Fear clauses always features a subjunctive verb in the present or imperfect tense.

When translating a fear clause, we translate **ne** as that. If the verb in the clause is in the present subjunctive, we translate it as "*would verb*." If the verb is in the imperfect subjunctive, we render it as "*verbed*." Below are some examples:

- Hostēs metuunt ne dux captus fugiat. ("The enemies fear that the leader who had been captured would escape.")

- Timuit ut uxor amaret. ("He was afraid that his wife did not love him.")
